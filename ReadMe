The game "TwentyFour" is a game in which the computer randomly generates you four numbers and you must type in "+", "-", "/", "*"
in order to achieve 24. Let us say the numbers generated are: 8 1 1 3. In order to achieve 24 you would do the following: (8 * 1 * 1 * 3). 
If your answer does not equal 24, the program will show you where you went wrong. There are many error checking, as well as Debug mode in 
which the computer runs all sequences of 4 digit numbers and produces answer of 24.
